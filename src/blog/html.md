# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all websites. It provides the basic structure of pages, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

## Basic HTML Document Structure

Every HTML document follows a standard structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
